'In Flanders Fields\n\nIn Flanders fields the poppies blow\nBetween the crosses, row on row,\nThat mark our place: and in the sky\nThe larks still bravely singing fly\nScarce heard amid the guns below.\n\nWe are the dead: Short days ago,\nWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\nLoved and were loved: and now we lie\nIn Flanders fields!\n\nTake up our quarrel with the foe\nTo you, from failing hands, we throw\nThe torch: be yours to hold it high\nIf ye break faith with us who die,\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow\nIn Flanders fields.\n\n-John McCrae'

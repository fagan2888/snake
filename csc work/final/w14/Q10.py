# list [6, 5, 2, 3, 7, 1, 4] is being sorted using insertion sort
# fill in the blanks to show the list after the next two passes:
# After one pass: [6, 5, 2, 3, 7, 1, 4]
# After two passes: [5, 6, 2, 3, 7, 1, 4]
# After three passes: [2, 5, 6, 3, 7, 1, 4]
# After four passes: [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1, 4]
# part(d):
# some number of iterations of selection sort have been performed
# on a list, resulting in: [1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 8, 7, 6, 9]
# what is the max # of passes that could have been performed so far?
# 2
# part(e):
# what additional info do you know abt the sorted section during
# selection sort that you don't know during insertion sort?
# A: that the items are in their correct final location.

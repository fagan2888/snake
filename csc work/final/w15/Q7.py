# see Q7
# (a) selection sort
# (b) insertion sort
# (c):
# list [7, 6, 3, 8, 1, 2, 0, 5] is being sorted using selection sort
# pass one: [0, 6, 3, 8, 1, 2, 7, 5]
# pass two: [0, 1, 3, 8, 6, 2, 7, 5]
# pass three: [0, 1, 2, 8, 6, 3, 7, 5]
# pass four: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 7, 5]
# (d):
# consider the list L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# which algorithm would you expect to have a faster runtime?
# insertion sort
